Objective: Develop a Task Manager App with the following functionalities:
1) Basic Features
○ Add tasks
○ Mark tasks as completed
○ Delete tasks
○ Filter tasks (All, Completed, Pending)
○ Persist tasks using Local Storage

2) Additional React Challenges

○ Custom Hooks: Create a useLocalStorage hook to handle local storage
operations.
○ Context API: Use React Context instead of prop drilling to manage task
data.
○ Performance Optimization: Use React.memo, useCallback, and
useMemo where applicable.
○ Form Validation: Prevent users from adding empty tasks.

3) Additional CSS Challenges

○ Theming (Dark Mode / Light Mode Toggle)
○ Animations (CSS transitions for adding/removing tasks)
○ Responsive Design (Mobile-first approach)
○ Task Drag-and-Drop (Using react-beautiful-dnd)

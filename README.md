Objective: Develop a Task Manager App with the following functionalities:
1) Basic Features
- Add tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Delete tasks
- Filter tasks (All, Completed, Pending)
- Persist tasks using Local Storage

2) Additional React Challenges

- Custom Hooks: Create a useLocalStorage hook to handle local storage
operations.
- Context API: Use React Context instead of prop drilling to manage task
data.
- Performance Optimization: Use React.memo, useCallback, and
useMemo where applicable.
- Form Validation: Prevent users from adding empty tasks.

3) Additional CSS Challenges
   
- Theming (Dark Mode / Light Mode Toggle)
- Animations (CSS transitions for adding/removing tasks)
- Responsive Design (Mobile-first approach)
- Task Drag-and-Drop (Using react-beautiful-dnd)
